# This is my solutions to the problems listed in Paul and Harvey Deitel's C How to Program 9th edition

Not all problems were solved, probably due to laziness.

There are no particular rules enforced.

Compile source files according to the Makefile provided.

```bash
make {program_name}
```

Should there be any concerns or corrections, feel free to email me about it or post a PR.
